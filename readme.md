# Lab | Cleaning numerical data

For this lab, we will be using the dataset in the Customer Analysis Business Case. This dataset can be found in `files_for_lab` folder.

## Context

An auto insurance company has collected some data about its customers including their _demographics_, _education_, _employment_, _policy details_, _vehicle information_ on which insurance policy, and _claim amounts_. You will help the senior management with some business questions that will help them to better understand their customers, improve their services, and improve profitability.

**Some business Objectives**:

- Retain customers,
- Analyze relevant customer data,
- Develop focused customer retention programs.

Based on the analysis, take targeted actions to increase profitable customer response, retention, and growth.

### Instructions

1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Load the `customer_value_analysis.csv` into the variable `customer_df`.
3. First look at its main features (`head`, `shape`, `info`).
4. Rename the columns so they follow the _PE8_ (snake case: lowecase_with_underscores).
5. Change the type of `effective_to_date` column to DateTime format.
6. Check `NaN` values per column.
7. Define a function that given an input dataframe, returns two dataframes: one with numerical columns and another with categorical columns of the input dataframe.
8. Drop any ID column.
9. Get the correlation matrix for the numerical variables. What is the pair of numerical variables that have the highest correlation? It makes sense, why?
10. Define a function that takes a pandas DataFrame as an input and returns two pandas DataFrames: the first containing numerical continuous columns and the second containing numerical discrete columns of the input dataframe. To this end, it might be helpful to count the number of unique values. The function **must have an optional argument set by default to 36** to discriminate between continuous and discrete columns. Then, use it to create two new dataframes: continuous_df and discrete_df. 
11. Create a function to create a barplot for all the columns of the discrete_df using seaborn, and set the figuresize = (16,16). 
12. Create a function to create a histogram for all the columns of the continuous_df using seaborn, and set the figuresize = (16,16)
13. According to the previous histogram plots, do you think that you will have to apply any transformation?
14. Look for outliers in the continuous variables that you have found. Hint: There was a good plot to do that. Define a function to create this kind of plot for the continuous_df.
